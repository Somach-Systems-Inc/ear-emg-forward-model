# Methods log

Decisions, specification defects and non-obvious tool behaviour, recorded as
they happen. Kept because the corrections here are often more instructive than
the original plans, and because a defect that is not written down gets paid for
twice.

Distinct from OUTLINE.md, which holds the paper's argument. This holds the
process.

## 2026-08-02 — SPEC DEFECT (mine, Carl): interface-proximity test was collinear by construction

**Requested:** measure forward error against source-to-interface distance on
the concentric validation sphere, to set an error envelope for sensitivity
values near compartment surfaces.

**Defect:** on a concentric sphere a source at radius *r* is at distance
(78 − *r*) mm from the innermost interface **by construction**. Distance to
interface and eccentricity are perfectly collinear, so no regression on that
geometry can separate them. The measurement came out backwards from the
hypothesis — RDM *fell* toward the interface, correlation +0.676 with distance —
which is what exposed it. That is the well-known degradation of forward
solutions for deep central sources, wearing the wrong label.

**Correction:** hold source radius fixed (~50 mm) and vary the *layer boundary*
radius (55, 60, 65, 70 mm). Interface distance varies, eccentricity is
constant, the geometry stays concentric so the analytic oracle still applies.
Preferred over an eccentric inclusion or a self-converged head reference, both
of which trade an exact oracle for an approximate one.

**Recorded as a specification defect, not a result.** The requested experiment
could not have answered the question asked of it.

## 2026-08-02 — TOOL BEHAVIOUR: `meshmesh` element-size range does not override the label-volume floor

**Cost:** one full convergence run (48 solves) that produced two densities
instead of three.

Asking for `elem_sizes = {"standard": {"range": [0.8, 2.5]}}` on a 0.5 mm label
volume produced a mesh **0.13% larger** than the default-range mesh, at
identical element size (648,170 vs 647,323 tets; h_mean 1.676 vs 1.677 mm).

Element size is floored by two things the size range does not override:

1. the **label volume resolution** — 0.5 mm voxels cannot support sub-millimetre
   tetrahedra faithfully
2. **MMG's remeshing pass**, which runs after CGAL and renormalises element
   sizes (visible as `Tetraedras after remeshing run 1/2` in the log)

**Consequences.** To refine, refine the *label volume* (or use
`--voxsize_meshing`), not the size range. To coarsen, the size range works
fine — which is why the three-density study is being completed by adding a
**coarser** density rather than a finer one, sidestepping the floor entirely at
the cost of one cheap solve.

**Check before trusting any density request:** compare `h_mean` between meshes,
never the requested range. Two meshes with the same `h_mean` are the same
experiment run twice.

## 2026-08-02 — MEASUREMENT: electrode meshing is per-site noise, not global scale

Two statistically identical sphere meshes (0.13% apart in element count) gave
MAG differing by **5.06 percentage points** and RDM by 0.54. Electrode contact
area is realised from incidental surface triangulation, so it changes
discontinuously when surface triangles move.

**This does not cancel in ratios.** Each electrode's contact is realised
independently, so the term is per-site noise rather than a global scale factor,
and it propagates into every site-to-site comparison the paper makes.
5.06% = 20·log₁₀(1.0506) = **0.43 dB**.

Two things follow. It sets the **resolution floor for the channel-redundancy
analysis**, where differences between adjacent sites may be smaller than the
noise. And it sits only ~2.3x below the boundary run's 1.0 dB decision
threshold, so a boundary shift under ~0.5 dB cannot be separated from meshing
noise by a single pair of solves.

## 2026-08-02 — RETRACTION: the +4.4% MAG figure

Reported as an accuracy figure before its repeatability was known. A nominally
identical mesh gives +9.5%. Withdrawn; MAG is not quotable at this precision
until the electrode confound is removed.

RDM is the more robust metric and carries the headline, with the caveat that
5.147 → 4.355 across two densities is **monotone decreasing across the two
available densities**, not a convergence demonstration. It does not become
"converged" until a rate is fitted across three genuine densities.

## 2026-08-02 — BLOCKER: 106 of 116 MIDA labels have no conductivity

The boundary run failed before producing a number:

    TypeError: The value 12 in cond_list is not numerical

SimNIBS requires a conductivity for **every tag present in the mesh**, not only
the ones the analysis reads. `config.SIGMA` holds 14 generic tissue values and
`config.MUSCLES` maps 10 muscle labels, so 106 of the mesh's 116 tags were
`None`.

This blocks **every** solve on the MIDA mesh, so it blocks stage 3 as well as
the boundary run. It is not specific to the boundary experiment.

Scale of the gap:

| | count |
|---|---|
| MIDA labels in the mesh | 116 |
| mechanically mappable to an existing `SIGMA` value by name | 69 |
| needing a newly sourced value | 47, of which one is Background |

The 46 real structures are roughly **7% of head tissue volume** (excluding
Background) and are dominated by deep brain nuclei, glands, tendons, dura and
mucosa: Dura, Parotid Gland, Mucosa, Galea Aponeurotica, Submandibular Gland,
the brainstem, Thalamus, Putamen, Caudate, Hippocampus, the tendons.

Most sit far from both the muscle compartments and the electrodes, so their
exact values will barely move a jaw or ear lead field — but SimNIBS cannot run
without them, and **this is Table 1 of the paper**, which per CLAUDE.md must
carry sourced values, not plausible ones. Not filled in by guessing.

**Design note for whoever fills it:** the mapping should be explicit
label → tissue → σ with a source per row, not a name-matching heuristic. The
69 "mechanically mappable" labels above were matched by regex to demonstrate
the scale of the problem; that is a diagnostic, not a proposal. `Teeth` matched
`bone_compact` by keyword and dentine is not compact bone.

## 2026-08-02 — STOP: step 1 results are invalid; every solve carries a current-calibration warning

**Do not use `results/03_conductivity_bound.csv`.** The numbers in it are
physically impossible and are withdrawn.

### What the numbers said

Condition d (ear air voids filled with bone) reported **+39.9 to +45.7 dB**
across *all ten* muscle compartments at the `hyoid` electrode. Filling the
mastoid air cells cannot change a hyoid lead field at all at that distance, and
a near-uniform shift across every compartment is the signature of a global
scaling, not a local physical effect. The reported "sensitivity envelope" of
47.5 dB is likewise not credible against a 0.43 dB meshing noise floor.

### What was actually wrong

Every one of the 20 solves wrote this into `fields_summary.txt`:

    The current calibration error exceeded 10%! Estimated error value: 200.00%

**I did not read the solver's own output file.** SimNIBS reported the failure
in writing and I took the field values anyway. This is precisely the failure
mode CLAUDE.md names — silence is the bug, except here it was not even silent.

### What is NOT yet established

The same warning appears in **39 of 83 sphere solves**, including ones behind
the reciprocity validation. That would imply the validation is invalid too —
except the sphere result agreed with the *analytic* oracle at magnitude ratio
0.9907, r = 0.997, which a genuine 200% current error cannot produce. The
sphere summaries also print `Cannot locate subjects m2m folder / some
postprocessing options might fail`, so the calibration check may simply be a
post-processing step that cannot run without an m2m folder and reports a
meaningless 200% for any custom mesh.

Both readings are live and they have opposite consequences:

- **benign** — the warning is a post-processing artefact of custom meshes; the
  reciprocity validation stands; the MIDA anomalies have some other cause still
  to be found
- **real** — currents are mis-delivered; the reciprocity result is coincidental
  and everything solved on a custom mesh is suspect

**Not resolved by guessing.** The decisive test is to solve a case with a known
answer *and* check the calibration line: the sphere against the analytic oracle
is exactly that, so re-running one sphere solve while inspecting delivered
current per electrode separates the two readings.

### Required before any further solving

1. Parse `fields_summary.txt` after **every** solve and hard-fail on a
   calibration warning. No result is read from a solve that reported an error.
2. Determine whether the warning is benign for custom meshes, by the test above.
3. Only then re-run step 1, and step 2 behind it.

### Partial signal, recorded but not trusted

Conditions b, c1 and c2 gave *sane* values at masseter (−2.3, +3.4, −1.3 dB),
so the conductivity sensitivity may well be small. That is a hint, not a
result, and it is not going in the error budget until the solves are clean.
